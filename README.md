PlotClock
=========

Fork of the plotclock optimized for better manfucaturability and for the available whiteboard markers.

* Larger material ring around screw holes for greater strength
* Larger holes for servo screws in the spacer plates.
* Claw now fits steadler whiteboard markers.
* M3 holes now accept 16 mm screws, because that what we had in stock.


TODO: 

* Go back to using filled shape for the servo-horn holes.
* Add text labels to each junction to make it easier to write an assembly manual.
